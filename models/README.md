- source_sentence: ukraine steel sell-off  illegal  the controversial sell-off of
    a ukrainian steel mill to a relative of the former president was illegal  a court
    has ruled.  the mill  krivorizhstal  was sold in june 2004 for $800m (£424m) -
    well below other offers. president viktor yushchenko  elected in december  is
    planning to revisit many of ukraine s recent privatisations. krivorizhstal is
    one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous
    administration.  on wednesday  prime minister yulia tymoshenko said as many as
    3 000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed.  mr
    yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to 30-40 enterprises.
    more than 90 000 businesses in all  from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts  have
    been sold off since 1992  as the command economy built up when ukraine was part
    of the soviet union was dismantled. analysts have suggested that the government
    needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list  so as to preserve investor
    confidence.  thursday s ruling by a district court in perchesk overturned a previous
    decision in a lower court permitting the sale. the consortium which won the auction
    for the mill was created by viktor pinchuk  son-in-law of former-president leonid
    kuchma  and rinat akhmetov  the country s richest man. the next step is for the
    supreme court to annul the sale altogether  opening the way for krivorizhstal
    to be resold. mr yushchenko has suggested a fair valuation could be as much as
    $3bn. one of the foreign bidders who lost out  steel giant lnm  told bbc news
    that it would be interested in any renewed sale.

  - france telecom gets orange boost strong growth in subscriptions to mobile phone
    network orange has helped boost profits at owner france telecom.  orange added
    more than five million new customers in 2004  leading to a 10% increase in its
    revenues. increased take-up of broadband telecoms services also boosted france
    telecom s profits  which showed a 5.5% rise to 18.3bn euros ($23.4bn; £12.5bn).
    france telecom is to spend 578m euros on buying out minority shareholders in data
    services provider equant.  france telecom  one of the world s largest telecoms
    and internet service providers  saw its full-year sales rise 2.2% to 47.2bn euros
    in 2004.  orange enjoyed strong growth outside france and the united kingdom -
    its core markets - swelling its subscriber base to 5.4 million. france telecom
    s broadband customers also increased  rising to 5.1 million across europe by the
    end of the year. the firm said it had met its main strategic objectives of growing
    its individual businesses and further reducing its large debt. an ill-fated expansion
    drive in the late 1990s saw france telecom s debt soar to 72bn euros by 2002.
    however  this has now been reduced to 43.9bn euros.  our results for 2004 allow
    us to improve our financial structure while focusing on the innovation that drives
    our strategy   said chief executive thierry breton.  looking ahead  the company
    forecast like-for-like sales growth of between 3% and 5% over the next three years.
    france telecom is consolidating its interest in equant  which provides telecoms
    and data services to businesses. subject to approval by shareholders of the two
    firms  it will buy the shares in equant it does not already own. france telecom
    said it would fund the deal by selling an 8% stake in telephone directory company
    pagesjaunes.

    of the game in allowing arsenal striker thierry henry s free-kick in sunday s
    2-2 draw with chelsea.  keeper petr cech was organising his defensive wall when
    henry s quick free-kick flew in  which angered chelsea.  the whistle doesn t need
    to be blown. i asked henry  do you want a wall  . he said  can i take it please   he
    was very polite. i said  yes    said poll.  i deal with the laws of the game.
    i deal with fact.  poll added:  i gave the signal for him to take it. that s what
    he did.  the same thing happened when i refereed chelsea against west ham in an
    fa cup replay two years ago - when jimmy floyd hasselbaink scored - and i don
    t remember them complaining about that.  henry explained why he paused before
    striking the ball for the goal  which put arsenal 2-1 ahead.  henry told bbc radio
    five live:  the ref asked me if i wanted 10 yards or if i wanted to take it straight
    away and i said that i wanted to take it straight away. he said to me   go .  it
    looks a bit strange because i took my time. i was waiting for eidur gudjohnsen
    to move and give me some space.  at one point  he turned and that s when i tried
    it.  former referees  chief philip don backed poll s decision to allow the strike.  the
    advantage should go to the non-offending team. on this occasion it was arsenal   don
    told bbc radio five live.  referees have been told to ask the player  do you want
    to take the quick free-kick   or  do you want me to get the wall back 9.15 metres    if
    they say  quick   the referee tends to move away and allow the kick.  don was
    head of the referees for the premier league and revealed all clubs were informed
    of free-kick options.  we spoke to all the premier league clubs as well as all
    the football league clubs in the summer of 2003 explaining what the situation
    was   he added  we gave them the option of either the quick free-kick or the  ceremonial  free-kick.
    players and clubs were aware of what referees were doing.'

- source_sentence: 'petrol duties frozen  brown says chancellor gordon brown has announced
    a freeze on fuel duty in his pre-budget speech to the commons on thursday.  mr
    brown told the house that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in
    line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments. but this financial
    year  because of  volatility in the oil market   he said the duty would be frozen.
    during 2000 many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists
    believe less duty means more pollution. he said:  it is our policy that each year
    fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our
    targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services.  but this
    financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market i propose
    to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze
    on the main road fuel duties.   the rac welcomed the news  calling it an  early
    christmas present  for motorists. but the organisation urged drivers to continue
    to shop around to get the best price for petrol. environmental group transport
    2000 said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists.  we are concerned that
    although britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails
    in practical action   said a spokesman. in 2000 the people s fuel lobby caused
    chaos by blocking roads with slow-moving convoys after mr brown threatened to
    raise fuel taxes. the chancellor did not raise duty that year  but despite threats
    of more protests in 2003  he added 1.28p per litre.'

  - can smith work scottish wonders  the worst kept secret in scottish football was
    revealed on thursday when walter smith was named as the new national manager.  from
    the moment berti vogts  miserable tenure in charge of scotland ended  the former
    rangers and everton boss has been the overwhelming favourite for the post. but
    is smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football  the 56-year-old
    takes over at a time when the national side is in the doldrums. scotland have
    not reached a major finals since the world cup in 1998 and reaching germany 2006
    looks near impossible  having picked up just two points from the opening three
    games in the qualifying race. and the fifa rankings see scotland listed at an
    all time low of 77th  below the likes of estonia  ghana  angola and thailand.
    scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level  so
    smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources. smith s track record
    make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game. the man who
    was alex ferguson s assistant when scotland played at the 1986 world cup won seven
    league titles with rangers. and his appointment has been widely endorsed by many
    of the games  top names  including ferguson and graeme souness  who took him to
    ibrox as his assistant in 1986. characters like souness  ferguson and current
    ibrox manager alex mcleish all cite smith s experience and his expansive knowledge
    of the scottish game.  much was made of vogts  inability to express himself to
    the players and media. that will certainly not be the case with smith. the former
    dundee united and dumbarton full-back is from the managerial old school - straight
    talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better (often with
    the use of some colourful invective). but it should be remembered vogts came to
    scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae - a world cup winner as a player
    and a european championships winner as a manager. smith will inherit the same
    problems vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents. and
    it remains to be seen if smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted
    so much of vogts  preparation work. a fresh start for the scottish national team
    was imperative and smith is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands. but will
    a safe pair of hands be enough when the adroit hands of a magician might be required...
  - beckham virus spotted on the net virus writers are trading on interest in david
    beckham to distribute their malicious wares.  messages are circulating widely
    that purport to have evidence of the england captain in a compromising position.
    but anyone visiting the website mentioned in the message will not see pictures
    of mr beckham but will have their computer infected by a virus. the pernicious
    program opens a backdoor on a computer so it can be controlled remotely by malicious
    hackers.  the appearance of the beckham windows trojan is just another example
    in a long line of viruses that trade on interest in celebrities in an attempt
    to fuel their spread. tennis player anna kournikova  popstars britney spears and
    avril lavigne as well as arnold schwarzenegger have all been used in the past
    to try to con people into opening infected files. the huge amount of interest
    in mr beckham and his private life and the large number of messages posted to
    discussion groups on the net might mean that the malicious program catches a lot
    of people out.  the public s appetite for salacious gossip about the private life
    of the beckhams might lead some into an unpleasant computer infection   said graham
    cluley from anti-virus firm sophos. simply opening the message will not infect
    a user s pc. but anyone visiting the website it mentions who then downloads and
    opens the fake image file stored on that site will be infected. the program that
    installs itself is called the hackarmy trojan and it tries to recruit pcs into
    so-called  bot networks that are often used to distribute spam mail messages or
    to launch attacks across the web. computers running microsoft windows 95  98  2000  nt
    and xp are vulnerable to this trojan. many anti-virus programs have been able
    to detect this trojan since it first appeared early this year and have regularly
    been updated to catch new variants.

  - 'brazil plays down varig rescue the brazilian government has played down claims
    that it could step in to save the country s biggest airline.  brazil s airport
    authority chief carlos wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping
    in to save varig  brazil s flagship airline. however  the country s vice president
    jose alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution. varig is
    struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of 6.5 billion reais
    ($2.3bn or £1.2bn). asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting
    of the country s congress to discuss the airline s crisis  mr alencar replied:  no  i
    don t think so. we will see.   earlier  mr wilson had said that president luiz
    inacio lula da silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention
    could be signed this week.  in practice  it will be an intervention  although
    this is not the technical name used   he said. an intervention means that the
    government would take administrative control of the company and its finances.
    for that to happen varig s main shareholder  the non-profit ruben berta foundation
    which represents the airline s employees  would have to be removed  mr wilson
    said. however  no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying  he
    added. varig  which operates in 18 countries apart from brazil  has been driven
    to the brink of collapse because of the country s economic downturn.  the depreciation
    of brazil s currency has had a direct impact on the airline s dollar debt as well
    as some of its costs. business has improved recently with demand for air travel
    increasing and a recovery in the brazilian economy. the airline could also win
    a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government. on tuesday
    the courts awarded varig 2bn reais ($725m)  after ruling in favour of its compensation
    claim against the government for freezing tariffs from 1985 to 1992. but the government
    can appeal the decision.'

  - amnesty chief laments war failure the lack of public outrage about the war on
    terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups  amnesty
    international s chief has said.  in a lecture at the london school of economics  irene
    khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since 11 september  2001.
    she said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent
    scepticism and spread a moral message. and it had to fight poverty  not just focus
    on political rights for elites.  ms khan highlighted detentions without trial  including
    those at the us camp at guantanamo bay in cuba  and the abuse of prisoners as
    evidence of increasing human rights problems.  what s a new challenge is the way
    in which this age-old debate on security and human rights has been translated
    into the language of war   she said.  by using the language of war  human rights
    are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war.  ms
    khan said such breaches were infectious and were now seen in almost very major
    country in the world.  the human rights movement faces a crisis of faith in the
    value of human rights   she said. that was accompanied by a crisis of governance  where
    the united nations system did not seem able to hold countries to account.  the
    amnesty secretary-general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of
    human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism.  public
    passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on
    the failures of human rights groups   she said. ms khan said the movement had
    failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights
    system. there needed to be a drive to use simpler language  talking about the
    basic morality of the issues rather than the complexity of legal processes. such
    efforts could make the issues more relevant to people across the world  she said.  the
    human rights groups also had to recognise there were new groups which had to be
    tackled in new ways as power dripped away from state governments. al-qaeda  for
    example  was not going to be impressed by a traditional amnesty letter writing
    campaign. more also needed to be done to develop a human rights framework for
    international business corporations. amnesty international members voted in 2001
    to extend the organisation s work from political and civil rights to cover social
    and economic rights too. ms khan said the human rights movement would make itself
    irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife.  we
    would be an elitist bunch working for the elites  for those who cannot read the
    newspaper of their choice rather than those who cannot read   she said. despite
    her concerns  ms khan dubbed herself a  hope-monger   saying she was confident
    the passions of the human rights movement could overcome the new challenges.

  - 'nat insurance to rise  say tories national insurance will be raised if labour
    wins the next election  tory leader michael howard has claimed.  tony blair has
    said he does not want higher tax rates for top earners but on wednesday said other
    tax promises would be left to labour s manifesto. prime minister s questions also
    saw mr blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration. he attacked
    tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but mr howard said labour had proposed
    the idea too.  the commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two
    biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. the tories have
    promised £4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. mr howard
    pointed to the institute for fiscal studies  predictions that labour will need
    to increase taxes to cover an £11bn gap in its spending plans. he accused ministers
    of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in
    schools and on slow asylum processing. it was no good mr blair claiming tax pledges
    were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to mps on tuesday about the
    top rate of income tax  argued mr howard. pointing to national insurance  he added:  everyone
    knows tax will go up under labour: isn t it now clear which tax it would be    mr
    blair instead hailed labour s achievement in using a strong economy to invest
    in public services.  when we have money not only going into extra teachers and
    nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals  that money is not wasted   he said.
    on the tax questions  he added:  we will make commitments on tax at the time of
    the manifesto.  home secretary charles clarke this week published plans for a
    new points system for economic migrants  with only high-skilled workers allowed
    into the uk from outside the european union.  mr blair said abuses would be weeded
    out and chain migration  where families automatically get the right to settle
    with immigrant workers  would end. that would probably create a fall in the migrant
    numbers  he said. the prime minister ridiculed the tory plans for asylum quotas
    and for processing all asylum claims overseas. he challenged the tories on which
    country would house their processing centres - what he called a  fantasy island
    . mr howard read from a letter about the government s own plans at the european
    council of ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the eu. but mr blair
    said:  all the other countries could not agree on the way forward  nor could the
    un.'

    evidence that china is taking a tougher line on protecting intellectual property
    rights.  a court ruled that chongqing lifan industry group must stop selling honda
    brand motorbikes and said it must pay 1.47m yuan ($177 600) in compensation. internationally
    recognized regulation is now a key part of china s plans for developing its economy  analysts
    said. beijing also has been threatened with sanctions if it fails to clamp down.  chinese
    firms copy products ranging from computer software and spark plugs to baby milk
    and compact discs. despite the fact that product piracy is a major problem  foreign
    companies have only occasionally won cases and the compensation awarded has usually
    been small. still  recent rulings and announcements will have boosted optimism
    that attitudes are changing. earlier this week china said that in future it will
    punish violators of intellectual property rights with up to seven years in jail.
    and on tuesday  paws incorporated - the owner of the rights to garfield the cat
    - won a court battle against a publishing house that violated its copyright. other
    firms that have taken legal action in china  with varying degrees of success  include
    yamaha  general motors and toyota.  the problem of piracy is not limited to china  however  and
    the potential for profit is huge. the european union estimates that the global
    trade in pirated wares is worth more than 200bn euros a year (£140bn; $258bn)  or
    about 5% of total world trade. and it is growing. between 1998 and 2002  the number
    of counterfeit or pirated goods intercepted at the eu s external borders increased
    by more than 800%  it said. last month the eu said it will start monitoring china  ukraine
    and russia to ensure they are going after pirated goods. other countries on the
