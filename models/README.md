- source_sentence: india s reliance family feud heats up the ongoing public spat between
    the two heirs of india s biggest conglomerate  reliance group  has spilled over
    to the board meeting of a leading company within the group.  anil ambani  vice-chairman
    of india petrochemicals limited (ipcl)  stayed away from a gathering of senior
    managers on thursday. the move follows a decision earlier this month by anil -
    the younger brother of reliance group president mukesh ambani - to resign from
    his post. his resignation was not accepted by his brother  who is also the boss
    of ipcl. the ipcl board met in mumbai to discuss the company s results for the
    october-to-december quarter.  it is understood that the board also considered
    anil s resignation and asked him to reconsider his decision. however  anil s demand
    that anand jain - another ipcl board member accused by anil of creating a rift
    in the ambani family - be thrown out  was not met. anil has accused anand jain  a
    confidant of his brother mukesh  of playing a negative role in the ambani family  and
    being responsible for the trouble between the brothers. on wednesday  the board
    of reliance energy  another reliance group company  reaffirmed its faith in anil  who
    is the company s chief. reliance group acquired the government s 26% stake in
    ipcl - india s second-largest petrochemicals company - in 2002  as part of the
    privatisation drive. meanwhile  the group s flagship company  reliance industries  has
    its board meeting on friday to consider its financial results. mukesh is the company
    s chairman and anil its deputy  and it is expected that both brothers will come
    face to face in the meeting. the ambani family controls 48% of the group  which
    is worth $17bn (Â£9.1bn; 745bn indian rupees). it was founded by their father  dhiru
    bhai ambani  who died two years ago.

  - no re-draft  for eu patent law a proposed european law on software patents will
    not be re-drafted by the european commission (ec) despite requests by meps.  the
    law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. some major tech
    firms say it is needed to protect inventions  while others fear it will hurt smaller
    tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that
    was agreed upon last may but said it would review  all aspects of the directive
    . the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use
    software to achieve their effect  in other words   computer implemented invention
    .  in a letter  ec president jos&#233; manuel barroso told the president of the
    european parliament  josep borrell  that the commission  did not intend to refer
    a new proposal to the parliament and the council (of ministers)  as it had supported
    the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004.  if the european council agrees
    on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european
    parliament. but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead
    it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. most
    eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers
    before it becomes law. french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that
    if the commission ignored the parliament s request it would be an  insult  to
    the assembly. he said that the parliament would then reject the council s version
    of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision
    procedure. in the us  the patenting of computer programs and internet business
    methods is permitted.  this means that the us-based amazon.com holds a patent
    for its  one-click shopping  service  for example. critics are concerned that
    the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe. this  they fear  could
    hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial
    might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. supporters
    say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field
    without bringing eu laws in line with the us.
  - troubled marsh under sec scrutiny the us stock market regulator is investigating
    troubled insurance broker marsh & mclennan s shareholder transactions  the firm
    has said.  the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about
    transactions involving holders of 5% or more of the firm s shares. marsh has said
    it is co-operating fully with the sec investigation. marsh is also the focus of
    an inquiry the new york attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market.
    since that inquiry was launched in october  marsh has replaced its chief executive
    and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company
    executives on the board. prosecutors allege that marsh - the world s biggest insurance
    broker - and other us insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover.
    this is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by new york s top law officer  eliot
    spitzer  and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the state of california.
    the sec s investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings
    in the trident funds  managed by mmc capital  the company s private equity firm.
    marsh s new chief executive  michael cherkasky  is trying to negotiate a settlement
    with mr spitzer. mr spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner
    against corporate america s misdeeds.  the uncertainty unleashed by the scandal
    has prompted three credit rating agencies - standard & poor s  moody s and fitch
    - to downgrade marsh in recent weeks. according to the financial times  insurance
    analysts are now questioning whether marsh will be able to maintain its strong
    record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next
    year. doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and
    lawyers to put the scandal behind.

    the possibility of perceived anti-religiosity   weitz told a his dark materials
    fans  website. pullman s trilogy has been attacked by some christian teachers
    and by the catholic press as blasphemy. weitz  who admitted he would not be many

    as  the most important work of my life .   in part because it is one of the few

    story of oxford school child lyra belacqua. she is drawn into an epic struggle
    against the church  which has been carrying out experiments on children in an
    attempt to remove original sin.  as the books progress the struggle turns into
    a battle to overthrow the authority  a figure who is god-like in the books. weitz  who
    directed american pie and about a boy  said new line feared that any anti-religiosity
    in the film would make the project  unviable financially . he said:  all my best

    any arbitrary establishment that curtails the freedom of the individual  whether
    it be religious  political  totalitarian  fundamentalist  communist  what have

    of the piece  but they may appear in more subtle guises.  there are a number of
    christian websites which attack the trilogy for their depiction of the church
    and of god  but pullman has denied his books are anti-religious. his agent told
    the times newspaper that pullman was happy with the adaptation so far.  of course

- source_sentence: bank opts to leave rates on hold the bank of england has left interest
    rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.  the bank s monetary policy
    committee (mpc) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy.
    but some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come
    later this year. interest rates rose five times between november 2003 and august
    2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears.
    bank of england governor mervyn king has recently warned against placing too much
    weight on one month s economic data  suggesting the mpc is waiting for a clearer
    picture to emerge. economists see next week s inflation report from the mpc as
    key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the
    economy in check.  slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely
    to have convinced the mpc that rates should be left unchanged in recent months.
    inflation  however  has been rising faster than expected  hitting an annual rate
    of 1.6% in december - its highest level in six months. data on wednesday also
    showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since may last month  reinforcing
    a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.  and recent house surveys
    from the halifax and nationwide have indicated prices are still rising  albeit
    at a slower pace than in recent years. philip shaw  chief economist at investec
    securities  said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year
    although strong economic data could lead to a further hike.  the economic landscape
    has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months    he said.  growth
    appears stronger and the mpc may become more concerned about inflation trends.  howard
    archer  economist at global insight said the mpc  may well consider that the balance
    of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the
    upside .  business groups welcomed the mpc s widely-expected move to leave rates
    on hold and cautioned against further rises. the british chambers of commerce
    (bcc) said it was  concerned by the clamour in some quarters  for early interest
    rate increases.  we believe that these demands should be firmly resisted   said
    david frost  bcc director general.  manufacturing still faces extremely serious
    problems and is performing poorly  in spite of the recent revised figures.  ian
    mccafferty  chief economist at the cbi  said the mpc faced an  interesting  challenge.  consumers
    appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period  and exporters are
    struggling with the strength of sterling   he said.  however  the broader economy
    continues to show healthy growth  and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity
    prices are nudging inflation higher.

  - eu  too slow  on economic reforms most eu countries have failed to put in place
    policies aimed at making europe the world s most competitive economy by the end
    of the decade  a report says.  the study  undertaken by the european commission  sought
    to assess how far the eu has moved towards meeting its economic targets. in 2000  eu
    leaders at a summit in lisbon pledged the european economy would outstrip that
    of the us by 2010. their economic targets became known as the lisbon agenda. but
    the commission report says that  in most eu countries  the pace of economic reform
    has been too slow  and fulfilling the lisbon ambitions will be difficult - if
    not impossible.  only the uk  finland  belgium  denmark  ireland and the netherlands
    have actually followed up policy recommendations. among the biggest laggards  according
    to the report  are greece and italy. the lisbon agenda set out to increase the
    number of people employed in europe by encouraging more older people and women
    to stay in the workforce. it also set out to raise the amount the private sector
    spends on research and development  while bringing about greater discipline over
    public spending and debt levels. combined with high environmental standards and
    efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the eu  the plan
    was for europe to become the world s most dynamic economy by 2010. next week  the
    commission will present revised proposals to meet the lisbon goals. many people
    expect the 2010 target to be quietly dropped.

    linesman andy davis  who had advised dallas to award rangers an injury-time penalty
    in hearts s 2-1 defeat at tynecastle.  he was sent off for violent conduct in
    the 90th minute but we don t know if he did something else after the whistle.  we
    don t know how many red cards he was shown   said an sfa statement. hearts could
    also face action after three fans were arrested for throwing coins on the pitch.
    rangers  striker dad prso was also sent off during the same incident when he received
    a second yellow card for wrestling the ball away from craig gordon and leaving
    the hearts keeper on the ground. the sfa said:  once the referee s report comes
    in then we ll immediately look at things.   we don t normally get the reports
    until a couple of days after the game but we re well aware of what happened here.  prso
    was sent off for two cautions  and that will just be a one-match suspension.  the
    sfa is certain to come down hard on mikoliunas after southampton s david prutton
    was banned for 10-games on wednesday by the english fa for shoving referee alan
    wiley. hearts  boss john robertson said:  mikoliunas has thrown his chest against
    the assistant referee s chest and got a red card for it.  the officials have got

    accepted referee dallas had no option but to send prso off. mcleish said:  i m
    glad to see the spirit of the players fighting to the very end - literally with

    united s failure to close the gap on chelsea  everton and arsenal after his side

    went ahead through alan smith in the 33rd minute before bouba diop s superb 25-yard
    strike cancelled out the visitors  lead in the 87th minute. ferguson described
    the result as an  absolute giveaway  after united had earlier missed a host of
    opportunities to finish off the encounter. he said:  it was a good performance
    - some of the football was fantastic - but we just didn t finish them off.  in
    fairness  it s a fantastic strike from the fulham player.  the result leaves ferguson

    (ea) says it wants to become the biggest entertainment firm in the world.  the
    us firm says it wants to compete with companies such as disney and will only achieve
    this by making games appeal to mainstream audiences. ea publishes blockbuster
    titles such as fifa and john madden  as well as video game versions of movies
    such as harry potter and the james bond films. its revenues were $3bn (Â£1.65bn)
    in 2004  which ea hoped to double by 2009. ea is the biggest games publisher in
    the world and in 2004 had 27 titles which sold in excess of one million copies
    each. nine of the 20 biggest-selling games in the uk last year were published
    by ea.  gerhard florin  ea s managing director for european publishing  said:  doubling
    our industry in five years is not rocket science.  he said it would take many
    years before ea could challenge disney - which in 2004 reported revenues of $30bn
    (Â£16bn) - but it remained a goal for the company.  we will be able to bring more
    people into gaming because games will be more emotional.  mr florin predicted
    that the next round of games console would give developers enough power to create
    real emotion.   it s the subtleties  the eyes  the mouth - 5 000 polygons doesn
    t really sell the emotion.   with ps3 and xbox 2  we can go on the main character
    with 30 000 to 50 000 polygons   he said.  with that increased firepower  the
    finding nemo video game looks just like the movie  but it will be interactive.  mr
    florin said that more than 50% of all ea s games were sold to adults and played
    by adults  but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children.  our
    goal is to bring games to the masses which bring out emotions.  ea said the video
    game industry was now bigger than the music industry.  nobody queues for music
    anymore.    you can t ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight
    because they are so desperate to play it   he said  referring to demand for titles
    for such as grand theft auto: san andreas and halo 2.  jan bolz  ea s vice president
    of sales and marketing in europe  said the firm was working to give video games
    a more central role in popular culture. he said the company was in advanced stages
    of discussions over a reality tv show in which viewers could control the actions
    of the characters as in its popular game the sims.  one idea could be that you
    re controlling a family  telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go
    to the bedroom  and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world  playing
    the show    said mr bolz.  he also said ea was planning an international awards
    show  similar to the oscars and the grammys  which would combine video games  music
    and movies. mr bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities.  people
    will want to play video games if their heroes like robbie williams or christina
    aguilera are in them.  mr florin said the challenge was to keep people playing
    in their 30s  40s and 50s.  there s an indication that a 30 year old comes home
    from work and still wants to play games.  if that s true  that s a big challenge

    added:  the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations
    and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark.  my
    job  along with all the other senior representatives  is to make sure that we
    pick the strongest possible team.  if you are not playing international rugby
    then it s still a step up to test rugby. it s definitely a disadvantage.   i think
    it s absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take
    players playing for the four countries.  woodward also revealed that the race
    for the captaincy was still wide open.  it is an open book   he said.  there are
    some outstanding candidates from all four countries.  and following the all blacks  impressive
    displays in europe in recent weeks  including a 45-6 humiliation of france  woodward
    believes the three-test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby
    challenge.  their performance in particular against france was simply awesome   said
    the lions coach.  certain things have been suggested about the potency of their
    front five  but they re a very powerful unit.  with his customary thoroughness  woodward
    revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white
    of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland.  as a result  woodward
    stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland
    and held out hope for the struggling scots.  scotland s recent results have not
    been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances.  eddie
    in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take
    on board their opinions.  and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get
    the call  provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems.  i took lessons
    from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he
    wasn t fit and went on the trip.  every player has to be looked at on their own
    merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and i have no doubts that if
    he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip.  i am told he should be back
    playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions
    - and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat.'

    to sustain the spam industry  a new study has found.  according to a survey conducted

    a third of e-mail users have clicked on links in spam messages. one in ten users
    have bought products advertised in junk mail. clicking on a link in a spam message
    can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e-mail accounts.  the
    fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues
    to make it an attractive business  especially given that sending out huge amounts
    of spam costs very little  the report concludes.  this preliminary data is surprising
    and somewhat shocking to us   said marcel nienhuis  market analyst at the radicati
    group.  it explains why e-mail security threats including spam  viruses and phishing
    scams continue to proliferate   he said  accusing users of  bad e-mail behaviour
    . spammers are increasingly hooking into whatever happens to be flavour of the
    month  according to security firm clearswift. it has recently seen a rise in the
    number of spam messages offering phoney sony psp giveaways. and  in perhaps a
    nod to the popularity of the american drama series desperate housewives  it has
    also seen a dramatic rise in junk mails purporting to give details of women looking
    for casual sex. but rather than finding a companion  users who click on such mail
    will find themselves redirected to porn sites  where they run the risk of downloading
    spyware on to their pc. clearswift has seen a 180% rise in sex-related spam over
    the course of the last month.  without casting aspersions  those likely to respond
    to these kind of adverts will be invariably hoping that  one thing leads to another  but
    aside from the fact that these mails are bogus  clicking on any link within a
    spam mail can lead to a whole host of unwanted problems   said alyn hockey  clearswift

    anti-spam filters. spammers will deliberately misspell a word or use digits instead
    of letters in an attempt to by-pass anti-spam software  said graham cluley  senior
    technology consultant for security firm sophos.  the list of words most commonly
    hidden by the spammers from anti-spam software reveals that most spam is about
    the old favourites: money  drugs and sex   said mr cluley. but anti-spam filters
    can only be part of the solution to the menace of junk e-mail.  people must resist
    their basic instincts to buy from spam mails. spammers are criminals  plain and
    simple. if no-one responded to junk e-mail and didn t buy products sold in this
    way  then spam would be as extinct as the dinosaurs   he said.'

    rise to the occasion   he said. but kirwan admits that a lot of hard work will
    be needed with his kickers before the trip to london. roland de marigny and luciano
    orquera had a miserable time with the boot in the dire defeat to scotland as chris
    paterson stole the show to give the hosts a much-needed 18-10 victory. kirwan
    said:  the kicking was the decisive factor in scotland which cost us and it could
    go down to the kicking again next time.  but i have a lot of confidence in my
    players and i am positive we can put everything together against england.  england  meanwhile  are
    licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee
    jonathan kaplan not gone against them in the second half in dublin. first mark
    cueto was judged offside as he chased fly-half charlie hodgson s kick  and then
    kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if josh lewsey had touched
    down after being driven over ireland s line.  but centre jamie noon believes the
    side at least showed better form than their previous two defeats.  we definitely
    improved against an in-form irish side   he said.  we went to dublin quietly confident
    that we would be able to compete  and i think we showed that.  we have got to
    make sure we now take the form and positives into the italy game. we are under
    no illusions that it is going to be easy  but we definitely need a win.  england
    have now equalled an 18-year low of four successive championship defeats  including
    france in paris last season  and have lost four in a row under andy robinson.
    his predecessor  sir clive woodward  began his seven-year reign with three defeats
    and two draws.'
  - israel looks to us for bank chief israel has asked a us banker and former international
    monetary fund director to run its central bank.  stanley fischer  vice chairman
    of banking giant citigroup  has agreed to take the bank of israel job subject
    to approval from parliament and cabinet. his nomination by prime minister ariel
    sharon came as a surprise  and led to gains on the tel aviv stock market. mr fischer  who
    speaks fluent hebrew  will have to become an israeli citizen to take the job.
    the us says he will not have to give up us citizenship to do so.  previous incumbent
    david klein  who often argued with the finance ministry  steps down on 16 january.
    mr fischer will face a delicate balancing act - both in political and economic
    terms - between mr sharon and finance minister binyamin netanyahu  who also backed
    his nomination. but his appointment has also raised hopes that it could bring
    in fresh investment - and perhaps even an improvement in the country s credit
    rating mr fischer first went to israel for six months in 1973  and almost emigrated
    there before deciding finally to return to the us. while teaching at the massachussetts
    institute of technology he spent a month seconded to the bank of israel in 1979  beginning
    a long-time involvement in studying israel s economy. in 1983 mr fischer became
    adviser on israel s economy to then-us secretary of state george shultz. at the
    world bank in 1985  he participated in drawing up an economic stabilisation package
    for israel.
  - 'speak easy plan for media players music and film fans will be able to control
    their digital media players just by speaking to them  under plans in development
    by two us firms.  scansoft and gracenote are developing technology to give people
    access to their film and music libraries simply by voice control. they want to
    give people hands-free access to digital music and films in the car  or at home
    or on the move. huge media libraries on some players can make finding single songs
    hard.  voice command-and-control unlocks the potential of devices that can store
    large digital music collections   said ross blanchard  vice president of business
    development for gracenote.  these applications will radically change the car entertainment
    experience  allowing drivers to enjoy their entire music collections without ever
    taking their hands off the steering wheel   he added.  gracenote provides music
    library information for millions of different albums for jukeboxes such as apple
    s itunes. the new technology will be designed so that people can play any individual
    song or movie out of a collection  just by saying its name. users will also be
    able to request music that fits a mood or an occasion  or a film just by saying
    the actor s name.  speech is a natural fit for today s consumer devices  particularly
    in mobile environments   said alan schwartz  vice president of speechworks  a
    division of scansoft.  pairing our voice technologies with gracenote s vast music
    database will bring the benefits of speech technologies to a host of consumer
    devices and enable people to access their media in ways they ve never imagined.  the
    two firms did not say if they were developing the technology for languages other
    than english. users will also be able to get more information on a favourite song
    they have been listening to by asking:  what is this   portable players are becoming
    popular in cars and a number of auto firms are working with apple to device interfaces
    to control the firm s ipod music player. but with tens of thousands of songs able
    to be stored on one player  voice control would make finding that elusive track
    by elvis presley much easier. the firms gave no indication about whether the ipod  or
    any other media player  were in mind for the use of the voice control technology.
    the companies estimate that the technology will be available in the fourth quarter
    of 2005.'
- source_sentence: 'straw backs ending china embargo uk foreign secretary jack straw
    has defended plans to end the european union s arms embargo on china  despite
    opposition from the us and japan.  mr straw  visiting beijing  noted arms embargoes
    applied to china  burma and zimbabwe but not to north korea  which he said had
    a terrible rights record. the eu imposed its arms ban on china in 1989 after troops
    opened fire on protestors in tiananmen square. mr straw also signed a deal on
    china-uk tourism. it is expected this would increase the number of chinese tourists
    by 40 000 per year  providing $120m in revenue. china has in the past said it
    sees the weapons ban as politically driven  and does not want it lifted in order
    to buy more weapons. mr straw  speaking at a joint news conference with chinese
    foreign minister li zhaoxing  stressed this point.  the result of any decision
    [to lift the arms embargo] should not be an increase in arms exports from european
    union member states to china  either in quantitative or qualitative terms   mr
    straw said. earlier this week he said he expected the embargo to be lifted within
    six months.  but mr straw faces tough opposition to the move. tory foreign affairs
    spokesman michael ancram said lifting the arms embargo would be  irresponsible  and
    would damage britain s relations with the us. he said mr straw was  naive beyond
    belief  if he accepted china s claim it does not want the ban lifted in order
    to buy weapons. the french want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms
    to china; the chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield
    technology from europe.  when he was in tokyo earlier this week  japanese foreign
    minister nobutaka machimura told the british minister that his plan to remove
    the embargo was   a worrying issue that concerns the security and environment
    of not only japan  but also east asia overall . washington argues that if the
    embargo is lifted  it could lead to a buying spree for arms that china could use
    to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan. beijing says taiwan is part of chinese
    territory and wants to unite it with the mainland  by force if necessary. the
    us is bound by law to help taiwan defend itself. washington has also voiced concern
    that the human rights conditions in china have not improved enough to merit an
    end to the embargo. it is an issue raised by human rights groups too. brad adams  from
    the uk s human rights watch  said:  this is a huge political signal from europe
    that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square.  but mr straw insisted
    the eu s code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights
    still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.'

  - argentina  venezuela in oil deal argentina and venezuela have extended a food-for-oil
    deal  which helped the former to overcome a severe energy crisis last year.  argentine
    president nestor kirchner and venezuelan president hugo chavez signed the deal
    in buenos aires on tuesday. last april  argentina signed a $240m agreement to
    import venezuelan fuel in exchange for agricultural goods and this deal has now
    been extended. venezuela will now import cattle  medicines and medical equipment.
    last year  argentina s severe energy crisis forced president kirchner to suspend
    gas exports to chile. argentina fears that rising demand could spark another crisis
    and wants to prevent it by signing this deal. the two countries also formalised
    a co-operation deal between venezuelan energy firm pdvsa and argentina s enarsa.
    under this deal  the argentine market will be opened to venezuelan investment.
    president chavez added that brazil s petrobras could join soon the co-operation
    deal. president chavez is an ardent promoter of the concept of a south american
    oil company  which could include the state-owned companies of venezuela  argentina  brazil
    and bolivia. the two presidents also agreed to create  television sur   a latin

  - jp morgan admits us slavery links thousands of slaves were accepted as collateral
    for loans by two banks that later became part of jp morgan chase.  the admission
    is part of an apology sent to jp morgan staff after the bank researched its links
    to slavery in order to meet legislation in chicago. citizens bank and canal bank
    are the two lenders that were identified. they are now closed  but were linked
    to bank one  which jp morgan bought last year. about 13 000 slaves were used as
    loan collateral between 1831 and 1865.  because of defaults by plantation owners  citizens
    and canal ended up owning about 1 250 slaves.  we all know slavery existed in
    our country  but it is quite different to see how our history and the institution
    of slavery were intertwined   jp morgan chief executive william harrison and chief
    operating officer james dimon said in the letter.  slavery was tragically ingrained
    in american society  but that is no excuse.   we apologise to the african-american
    community  particularly those who are descendants of slaves  and to the rest of
    the american public for the role that citizens bank and canal bank played.   the
    slavery era was a tragic time in us history and in our company s history.  jp
    morgan said that it was setting up a $5m scholarship programme for students living
    in louisiana  the state where the events took place. the bank said that it is
    a  very different company than the citizens and canal banks of the 1800s .
  - media seek jackson  juror  notes reporters covering singer michael jackson s trial
    in california have asked to see questionnaires completed by potential jurors.  lawyers
    for news organisations said it was  really vital  for the responses of 250 potential
    jurors to be made public  to serve as a check on the process . santa barbara county
    superior court is due to consider the request on monday. mr jackson denies child
    molestation. it is estimated his trial will cost santa barbara county up to $4m
    (Â£2.13m).  meanwhile michael jackson s mother has said she is  100% certain  her
    son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. the court is currently selecting
    12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial  a process delayed until at
    least thursday after a member of the star s legal team was hit by family illness.
    defence lawyers argued against the bid by associated press and other news organisations
    to have potential jurors  responses made public.   the release of the completed
    jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist
    coverage of this case   a motion by mr jackson s lawyers stated. the estimated
    total costs of the trial  expected to last five months  range from $2.5m (Â£1.33m)
    to $4m (Â£2.13m) of local taxpayers  money. those estimates do not include costs
    to the city of santa maria  the superior court or for the investigation and prosecution
    of the case. the cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been
    estimated at $40 000 (Â£21 000) per day  said jason stilwell  a special projects
    manager at the county administrator s office.  mr jackson  46  denies plying a
    boy with alcohol and molesting him. his mother katherine jackson told us tv network
    fox news on sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent.  i believe
    that for one reason - i know his character   she said.  he loves children. you
    don t molest anything that you love.  describing mr jackson as  a good person   the
    mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial.  i can t sleep

  | <code>moreno debut makes oscar mark catalina sandino moreno has joined a rare group of actresses who have been nominated for an oscar for starring in a foreign language film.  the colombian-born actress was the final hope for director joshua marston  who scoured the us and colombia for a lead for maria full of grace. the film sees the 23-year-old play a teenage drug mule who smuggles heroin by swallowing pellets in condoms. plaudits have been raining down on her for her gritty performance  making it all the more surprising that this is her first film. her previous acting experience was in amateur productions in her home city of bogota at the ruben di pietro theatre academy. she has already received a nomination for the independent spirit awards leading actress category but these rarely overlap with academy awards  instead recognising quirkier  low-budget films. and at the 2004 berlin film festival the jury could not choose between her and charlize theron s oscar winning performance in monste...</code> | <code>jones happy with henson heroics wales fly-half stephen jones admitted he was happy to hand gavin henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against england.  jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when wales  9-8 down  were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in cardiff.  i knew the percentages of gavin reaching it were far higher than me   jones said.  when he said he wanted it  there were no problems.  jones had seen a long-range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour  before charlie hodgson put england in front with 10 minutes left.  i looked at where it was and i knew i was going to struggle to make it   jones added.  i said to gareth (thomas  the wales captain)  this is touch and go.  it was out of my range and obviously gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance. he was confident and fancied it.  there were no questions that he d miss it the way he was playing. he had a superb game.  jones was happy to hail henson s heroic contr...</code> |
  | <code>retail sales show festive fervour uk retail sales were better than expected in november as christmas shoppers began their seasonal flock to the high street  figures show.  the office for national statistics (ons) said retail sales rose 0.6% on the month and 6.1% on the year. but the figures  along with this week s inflation report  could trigger another interest rate rise in the new year. however  recent data from the british retail consortium showed a 0.2% slip in high street sales during november.  the ons data confounded analyst expectations. many had expected sales to fall slightly in november as shoppers put off buying christmas presents until december. however  retailers  attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind november s unexpected rise in sales  they say. aggressive tactics  such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as marks & spencer  appear to have paid off.  price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales hasn t g...</code> | <code>lse doubts boost bidders  shares shares in deutsche boerse have risen more than 3% after a shareholder fund voiced opposition to the firm s planned takeover of the london stock exchange.  tci  which claims to represent owners of 5% of deutsche boerse s (db) shares  has complained that the Â£1.35bn ($2.5bn) offer for the lse is too high. opposition from tci has fuelled speculation that the proposed takeover could fail. rival exchange operator euronext has also said it may bid for the lse. euronext operates the paris  amsterdam  brussels and lisbon bourses  while deutsche boerse runs the frankfurt exchange.  bbc news spoke to a number of analysts on monday morning about shareholder worries over deutsche boerse s bid for lse. although none were prepared to speak on the record  most thought it was unlikely that tci s opposition would halt the deal   obviously we ll have to wait and see  but i don t think it will make much difference. deutsche boerse appears very committed   said one london-...</code> |
  | <code>police probe bnp mosque leaflet police are investigating a british national party leaflet posted to homes in south wales opposing plans for a new mosque.  anti-racism campaigners in swansea have handed copies to south wales police. swansea s muslim community is raising money to open a new mosque and community centre in the former st andrews united reform church. the building on george street has been derelict since the 1980s.  taha idris  director of the swansea bay race equality council  said his organisation contacted police after receiving complaints from the public.  i m quite shocked to see this sort of leaflet by the bnp in swansea   he said.   the bnp has tried in the past to get into swansea and this is another example of them trying again.  i am in no doubt that the bnp are not needed and not wanted here.  a south wales police spokeswoman confirmed that they were looking at the contents of the leaflet. according to the bnp s website  they have been posted to homes in the castl...</code> | <code>profile: gordon brown the ultimate prize of 10 downing street may continue to elude him but  as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget  gordon brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times.  he reached that milestone last june  when he overtook david lloyd george  who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915. how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor:  those who fail and those who get out in time. ) there are rumours he will be moved to the foreign office if labour wins the general election. but  for now  mr brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him.  gordon brown was born in glasgow on 20 february 1951  the son of a church of scotland minister in the small fife town of kirkcaldy. at 12  he was canvassing for labour and by his 20s he was a leading political activist in sc...</code> |
